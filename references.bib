  abstract   = {5G introduces Rich Communication Services (RCS) as the official messaging service. It replaces SMS with rich multimedia content over the chat session. RCS intends to provide “any network, any device” messaging services for a given user across various network (4G/5G or Wi-Fi) and devices (SIM-based phones or SIM-free tablets/gadgets). This work provides the first in-depth study of RCS system security. We find that although RCS is one of the mobile carrier services, it performs a weak cellular ID binding, which opens a door for attackers to hijack the victim's RCS service. Even with end-to-end encryption in place, impersonation and eavesdropping over chat messages are still feasible. The attacks could be persistent and stealthy. With abused RCS service, victims are vulnerable to various attacks of fraud, location tracking, unauthorized operations on business accounts, and spamming. We have empirically validated such attacks in 4 major US mobile carriers by following ethical requirements. We further propose and implement both long-term solutions and immediate remedies.},

The underplayed IMS core network provide a powerful infrastructure for the deployment of such innovative suite addressing both mobile and internet access. The commercial specifications are based on the first release of the RCS specification which was finalized in December 2008. This specification is based on profiling of existing standards and specifications from OMA, GSMA and 3GPP fora. It focuses on mobile and includes 3 main features: Enriched Call, Enhanced Messaging and Enhanced Phonebook. The construction of such an offer is, from the technology point of view, an exiting challenge that architects from Orange groups work on.},

  abstract   = {Text messages sent via the Short Message Service (SMS) have revolutionized interpersonal communication. Recent years have also seen this service become a critical component of the security infrastructure, assisting with tasks including identity verification and second-factor authentication. At the same time, this messaging infrastructure has become dramatically more open and connected to public networks than ever before. However, the implications of this openness, the security practices of benign services, and the malicious misuse of this ecosystem are not well understood. In this paper, we provide the first longitudinal study to answer these questions, analyzing nearly 400,000 text messages sent to public online SMS gateways over the course of 14 months. From this data, we are able to identify not only a range of services sending extremely sensitive plaintext data and implementing low entropy solutions for one-use codes, but also offer insights into the prevalence of SMS spam and behaviors indicating that public gateways are primarily used for evading account creation policies that require verified phone numbers. This latter finding has significant implications for research combatting phone-verified account fraud and demonstrates that such evasion will continue to be difficult to detect and prevent.},

SMS technology evolved out of the global system for mobile communications standard, an internationally accepted cell phone network specification the European Telecommunications Standards Institute created. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project maintains the SMS standard. SMS messages are handled via a short message service center that the cellular provider maintains for the end devices. The SMSC can send SMS messages to the end device using a maximum payload of 140 octets. This defines the upper bound of an SMS message to be 160 characters using 7-bit encoding. It is possible to specify other schemes such as 8-bit or 16-bit encoding, which decreases the maximum message length to 140 and 70 characters, respectively.},

  abstract  = {5G messaging services, based on Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) Rich Communication Service (RCS) and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), have been deployed globally by more than 90 mobile operators serving over 421 million monthly active users via 1.2 billion devices. Despite the widespread use, security research of 5G messaging remains sparse. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis and measurement of 5G messaging services, assisted by a semi-automated testing tool we developed. We considered both carrier-side deployment and phone-side software implementations by testing against three large operators, each with hundreds of millions of subscribers, and six popular 5G messaging-enabled devices. We uncovered 4 categories of vulnerabilities, allowing for a wide range of attacks, including Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, zero-click remote information leakage, phone storage exhaustion and mobile data consumption, and Denial-of-Services (DoS) attacks. Our study underscores the need for further security enhancements in security specifications, implementation, and deployment of 5G messaging services.},
